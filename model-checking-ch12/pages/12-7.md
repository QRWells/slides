# Partial Order Reduction in SPIN
Introduction to SPIN and Promela

SPIN is an on-the-fly LTL model checker that uses explicit state enumeration and partial order reduction.
The modeling language is Promela, which is inherited from C.

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Has most operators of C (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `!`, `&&`, `||`)
- Syntax for communication commands is inherited from CSP.
  - For message with tag `tg` and values `v1`, `v2`, ..., `vn`, and channel `ch`:
  - Send: `ch!tg(v1, v2, ..., vn)`
  - Receive: `ch?tg(v1, v2, ..., vn)`
  - Conditional constructs and loops are based on Dijkstra’s guarded commands

# POR in SPIN
Leader election algorithm

Demonstration of the reduction obtained by the technique we discussed in the previous section.

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Each process $P_i$ is initially *active* and holds some integer local variable `my_val`.
- $P_i$ is responsible for a volatile variable held in `max` while it is active.
- $P_i$ becomes *passive* when it finds out that it does not hold a value that can be the maximum one.
  - *Passive* processes can pass messages only from left to right.
  - *Active* processes sends its own value to the right and then waits to receive the value of the closest active process $P_j$ on its left.
- The value is received with tag `one`.

<v-clicks depth="4">

- If the value received by $P_i$ is the same as the value it sent
  1. It is the only active process and the value is maximum.
  2. Sends the value to the right with tag `winner`.
  3. Every other process receives this value and sends it to the right exactly once.
      - So that all processes acknowledge the winner.
- If the value received by $P_i$ is not the same as the value it sent
  1. Waits for a second message tagged `two` including the value of the second closest active process on its left $P_k$.
  2. Compares the two values from $P_j$ and $P_k$
     - If the value from $P_j$ is largest, then keeps own value.
       - $P_i$ becomes responsible for the role of the closest active process $P_j$.
     - Otherwise, becomes passive.

# POR in SPIN
Leader election algorithm

The execution of the algorithm can be divided into phases.

<v-clicks depth="1">

- In each phase except the last one, all of the active processes receive messages tagged with `one` and `two`.
- In the last phase, remaining process receives its own value via a message tagged with `one` and then this value is propagated through the ring.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

The protocol guarantees low message complexity $O(N\times\log(N))$

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- At least half of the active processes become passive in each phase.

  *Example*: $P_i$ remains active. Then the value of $P_j$ must be bigger than
  that of $P_i$ and $P_k$.
  - If $P_j$ also survives, then the value of $P_k$ must be bigger than $P_j$. **Contradiction**
  - Thus, in each phase except for the last, if a process remains active, the first active process to its left must become passive.
- In each phase, the number of messages passed is limited to $2N$, since each process receives two messages from its left neighbor.

# POR in SPIN
Promela model for leader election algorithm

<v-clicks depth="1">

- Code for initialization is omitted.
- Channel $q[(i+1)\%N]$ is used to send messages from $P_i$ to $P_{(i+1)\%N}$.
- The property for checking is given by the LTL formula

  $$
  \texttt{noLeader}\;\mathcal{U\;G}\;\texttt{oneLeader}
  $$

  The negation of the checked property is automatically translated into a Büchi automaton, based on the algorithm in ***Section 7.10***.

# POR in SPIN
Never claim

The automaton is described as ***never claim***

<v-clicks depth="2">

- The automaton, obtained by translating the negation of the checked property, represents the computations that should **never** happen.
- Label of each initial node contains `init`,
- Label of each accepting node contains `accept`.
- SPIN intersects the program automaton and the never claim automaton.
  - Double DFS algorithm, described in ***Section 7.5***.
  - Partial order reduction.
- If the intersection is not empty, an error trace will be reported.
