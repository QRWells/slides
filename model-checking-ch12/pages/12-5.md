Review

<Condition title="C0">

$\mathit{ample}(s)=\varnothing\iff\mathit{enabled}(s)=\varnothing$.

</Condition>
<Condition title="C1">

For every path in the full state graph that start at $s$
- A transition that is denpendent on a transition in $\mathit{ample}(s)$ cannot be executed without a transition in $\mathit{ample}(s)$ occuring first.

</Condition>
<Condition title="C2">

If $s$ is not fully expanded, then every $a\in\mathit{ample}(s)$ is invisible.

</Condition>
<Condition title="C3">

A cycle is not allowed if it contains a state in which some transition $a$ is enabled, but is never included in $\mathit{ample}(s)$ for any state $s$ on the cycle.

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions

<Theorem title="12.4">

Checking condition **C1** for a state $s$ and a set of transitions $T\in\mathit{enabled}(s)$ is at least as hard as checking reachability for the full state graph.

</Theorem>

<v-click>

<span class="font-serif italic font-bold">Proof.</span>

Consider checking whether a state $r$ is **reachable** in a transition system $\mathcal{T}$ **from** an initial state $s_0$. And reduce this problem to deciding condition **C1**.

</v-click>
<v-click>

Assuming 2 new transition

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- $\alpha$ is only enabled at $r$.
- $\beta$ is enabled from the initial state $s_0$
  - And independent of all transitions of $\mathcal{T}$.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

We construct them so that they are **dependent**. 
- **e.g.** they change same variable

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions
proof of Theorem 12.4

<v-clicks depth="3">

- Consider $\{\beta\}$ as a candidate for $\mathit{ample}(s_0)$
  - Assume **C1** is violated
    - There is a path in the new state graph that $\alpha$ is performed before $\beta$.
    - This path leads from $s_0$ to $r$. ($\alpha$ is only enabled at $r$)
    - Transition sequence from $s_0$ to $r$ also exists in the original state graph.
  - $r$ is reachable from $s_0$ in the original state graph.
- If $r$ is reachable from $s_0$ in the original state graph
  - There is a transition sequence from $s_0$ to $r$ does not contain $\beta$.
  - This sequence is also appears in the new state graph.
    - Can be extended by $\alpha$ taken at $r$.
  - Violates **C1**.

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions
Checking **C3**

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Checking **C1** for arbitrary subset of enabled transitions should be avoided.
  - An efficient procedure will be introduced in the next section.
  - Trade-off between efficiency of computation and the amount of reduction.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

**C3** is also defined in global terms but refers to reduced state graph.
- Generate a reduced state graph and then to correct it by adding additional transitions until it satisfies **C3**.
- Replace **C3** by a stronger condition that can be checked directly from current state.

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions

<Lemma class="mt-8" title="12.5">

At least one state along each cycle is fully expanded $\implies$ **C3** is satisfied.

</Lemma>

<v-click>

<span class="font-serif italic font-bold">Proof.</span>

Assume there is a cycle with a fully expanded state, and the cycle doesn't satisfy condition C3.

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- There exists a transition $\alpha$ that is enabled in a state $s$ of the cycle but is never included in an ample set along the cycle.
- By *lemma 12.3*, $\alpha$ is independent of all transitions in the ample sets selected along the cycle.
  - $\alpha$ remains enabled in all the states along the cycle.
- If a state s′ is fully expanded ($\mathit{ample}(s^\prime) = \mathit{enabled}(s^\prime)$), $\alpha$ must be included in $\mathit{ample}(s^\prime)$.
  - Contradicts the assumption that $\alpha$ is never selected.

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions
Strengthening **C3**

The search strategy, used to generate the reduced state graph, affects the ways of enforcing **C3**.

<v-click>

#### Depth-first search

</v-click>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Every cycle contains an edge the goes back to a node on the search stack.
  - Such an edge is called a **back edge**.

</v-clicks>

<Condition v-click title="C3'">

A cycle is not allowed if it contains a state in which some transition $a$ is enabled, but is never included in $\mathit{ample}(s)$ for any state $s$ on the cycle, and $a$ is not a back edge.

</Condition>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- We thus always try to select an ample set that does not include a back edge.
  - If we do not succeed, the current state is fully expanded.

</v-clicks>

# The Complexity of Checking the Conditions
Strengthening **C3**

<v-click>

#### Breadth-first search
**Search will run in levels**

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- level $k$ consists
  - a set if states reachable from the initial state using $k$ transitions.
- Closing a cycle during BFS needs a transition applied to a state $s$ in the current level:
  - Results in $s$ itself, in which case there is a self loop
  - Results in a state $s^\prime$ at a previous level of the BFS.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

But $s^\prime$ may not be an ancestor of the current state.

- Using this condition to detect when a cycle is closed **may cause** more states than necessary to be fully expanded.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
A more efficient way

We have seen the complexity results in the previous section. And we will introduce some heuristics to calculate ample sets.

The algorithm depends on the computation model.
- We consider shared variables, and message passing with handshaking and with queues.

All computation models have a notion of ***program counter***(**pc**), which is part of the state.
- Denotes the **pc** of a process $P_i$ in a state $s$ by $\mathit{pc}_i(s)$.

Some notation will be used to present the algorithm.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Notations for the algorithm

<Notation title="\mathit{pre}(\alpha)">

Set includes all the transitions $\beta$ such that there exists a state $s$ for which $\alpha\notin\mathit{enabled}(s),\beta\in\mathit{enabled}(s)$, and $\alpha\in\mathit{enabled}(\beta(s))$.

</Notation>

<Notation title="\mathit{dep}(\alpha)">

Set of transitions that are dependent on $\alpha$; that is
$
  \{\beta\vert(\beta,\alpha)\in D\}.
$

</Notation>

<Notation title="T_i">

Set of transitions of process $P_i$.

$T_i(s)=T_i\cap\mathit{enabled}(s)$ denotes the set of transitions of $P_i$ that are enabled in state $s$.

</Notation>

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Notations for the algorithm

<Notation title="\mathit{current}_i(s)">

Set of transitions of $P_i$ that are enabled in some state $s^\prime$ such that $\mathit{pc}_i(s^\prime)=\mathit{pc}_i(s)$

In addition, it may include transitions whose **pc** has the value $\mathit{pc}_i(s)$, but are not enabled in $s$.

</Notation>

<Note v-click>

transitions in $\mathit{current}_i(s)$ must be executed ***before*** other transitions of $T_i$ can execute.

</Note>
<v-click>

The difinition of $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ and dependency relation $D$ is not exact:

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ may contain transitions that do not enable $\alpha$.
- $D$ may include pairs of transitions that are independent.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

The flexibility enables the algorithm to be *efficient* and keeps the *correctness of the reduction*.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Specialize $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$

$\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ can be specialized for various computation models. We construct $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ as follows:

<v-clicks>

- $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ includes the transitions of the processes that contain $\alpha$, and that can change the **pc** to a value from which $\alpha$ can execute.
- If the enabling condition for $\alpha$ involves *shared variables*, then $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ includes all other transitions that can change these *shared variables*.
- If $\alpha$ sends or receives data on some queue $q$, then $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ includes the transitions of other processes that receive or send data through $q$.

</v-clicks>

---
level: 2
hideInToc: true
---

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Specialize dependency relation $D$

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Pairs of transitions that modify the *same shared variable* are dependent.
- Pairs of transitions in the same process are dependent. Including pairs of transitions in $\mathit{current}_i(s)$ for any given state $s$ and process $P_i$. 
  - A transition that involves handshaking or rendezvous communication as in CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) or ADA can be treated as a *joint* transition of both processes.
  - Therefore, it depends on all of the transitions of both processes.
- Two send/receive transitions that use the same message queue are dependent.
  - The contents of the queue depends on their order of execution.

</v-clicks>

<Note v-click>

A pair of send and receive transitions in ***different processes*** that use the ***same message queue*** are **independent**. This is because any one of these transitions can potentially enable the other but cannot disable it.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Checking condition **C1**

<v-clicks depth="2">

- $T_i(s)$ is an obvious candidate for $\mathit{ample}(s)$.
- An ample set must include all or none of the transitions in $T_i(s)$.
   - Transitions in $T_i(s)$ are dependent on each other.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Steps to construct $\mathit{ample}(s)$

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="4">

1. Select some process $P_i$ that $T_i(s)\neq\varnothing$.
2. Check whether $\mathit{ample}(s)=T_i(s)$ satisfies **C1**.
   - There are two cases might violate **C1**. In both of them
     - Some transitions independent of $T_i(s)$ are executed and eventually enable a transition $\alpha$ that is dependent on $T_i(s)$.
     - The independent transitions cannot be in $T_i(s)$.
       - All transitions of $P_i$ are dependent on each other.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Checking condition **C1**

About the 2 cases violating **C1**.
1. $\alpha$ belongs to some other process $P_j$.
   - $\mathit{dep}(T_i(s))$ needs to include a transition of $P_j$.
   - This could be checked by examining the dependency relation.
2. $\alpha$ belongs to $P_i$.
   - Suppose $\alpha\in T_i(s)$ that violates **C1** is executed from a state $s^\prime$.
     - The transitions from $s$ to $s^\prime$ are independent of $T_i(s)$, so they are from other processes.
     - $\mathit{pc}_i(s^\prime)=\mathit{pc}_i(s)$, so $\alpha$ must be in $\mathit{current}_i(s)$.
   - $\alpha\notin T_i(s)$, otherwise it satisfies **C1**. $\implies\alpha\in\mathit{current}_i(s)\backslash T_i(s)$.
     - $\alpha$ is disabled in $s$.
     - a transition in $\mathit{pre}(\alpha)$ must be included in the sequence from $s$ to $s^\prime$.
   - $\mathit{pre}(\mathit{current}_i(s)\backslash T_i(s))$ needs to include transitions of other processes.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Checking condition **C1**

In both cases we discard $T_i(s)$ and try $T_j(s)$ as a candidate for $\mathit{ample}(s)$.

<v-click>

- Our conservative approach may discard some ample sets even though they satisfy **C1** at runtime.

</v-click>
<v-click>

Thus, the code for checking **C1** is shown as follows.

# Heuristics for Calculating Ample Sets
Algorithm for calculating ample sets

The algorithm tries to find a process $P_i$ such that $T_i(s)$ satisfies conditions **C0**–**C3**.
- If no such process exists, the algorithm returns $\mathit{enabled}(s)$.
