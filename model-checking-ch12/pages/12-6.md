# Correctness of the Algorithm
Necessary denotations

Some denotations used in the following part:

<v-clicks depth="2">

- $M$: The full state graph of some system.
- $M'$: A reduced state graph constructed using the POR algorithm in **section 12.1**.
- *string*: A sequence of transitions from $T$.
- $\mathit{vis}(v)$: The projection of $v$ onto the visible transitions.
  - $v$: finite or infinite *string*.
  - If $a,b$ are visible and $c,d$ are not, then $\mathit{vis}(abddbcbaac) = abbbaa$.
- $\mathit{tr}(\sigma)$: The sequence of transitions on a path $\sigma$.
- Let $v$ and $w$ be two finite *strings*. $v \sqsubset w$ means $v$ can be obtained from $w$ by erasing at least one transition.
  - $abbcd\sqsubset aabcbccde$
  - $v\sqsubseteq w$ if $v=w$ or $v\sqsubset w$.

# Correctness of the Algorithm
Paths construction

<v-clicks depth="2">

- $\sigma^o\eta$: Concatenation of paths $\sigma$ and $\eta$ of $M$.
  - $\sigma$ is finite, and last state of $\sigma$ is the same as the first state of $\eta$.
  - $|\sigma|$: Length of $\sigma$, i.e., number of edges of $\sigma$.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Let $\sigma$ be some *infinite* path of $M$ starting with some initial state.
We will construct an *infinite* sequence of paths $\pi_0, \pi_1, \ldots$ where $\pi_0=\sigma$
- $\pi_i$ will be decomposed into $\eta_i^o\theta_i$, where $\eta_i$ is of length $i$.

</v-click>
<v-click>

Assume that the sequence $\pi_0, \ldots, \pi_i$ has been constructed. We show how to construct $\pi_{i+1}= \eta_{i+1}^o\theta_{i+1}$.

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- Let $s_0=\mathit{last}(\eta_i)=\mathit{first}(\theta_i)$.
- Let $\alpha$ be the transition labeling the first edge of $\theta_i$.
- Denote $\theta_i=s_0\xrightarrow{\alpha_0=\alpha}s_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}s_2\xrightarrow{\alpha_2}\ldots$

# Correctness of the Algorithm
Paths construction

There are two cases:

<div class="alpha">
<v-clicks depth="3">

1. $\alpha\in\mathit{ample}(s_0)$.
   - Select $\eta_{i+1}=\eta_{i}\circ(s_0\xrightarrow{\alpha}\alpha(s_0))$
     - $\theta_{i+1}=s_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}s_2\xrightarrow{\alpha_2}\ldots$, i.e., $\theta_{i}$ without the first edge.
2. $\alpha\notin\mathit{ample}(s_0)$.
   - By **C2**, all transitions in $\mathit{ample}(s_0)$ must be invisible, since $s_0$ is not fully expanded.
   1. Some $\beta\in\mathit{ample}(s_0)$ appears on $\theta_i$ after some sequence of independent transitions $\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2\ldots\alpha_{k-1}$, i.e. $\beta=\alpha_k$.
      - $\xi=s_0\xrightarrow{\beta}\beta(s_0)\xrightarrow{\alpha_0=\alpha}\beta(s_1)\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}\ldots\xrightarrow{\alpha_{k-1}}\beta(s_k)\xrightarrow{\alpha_{k+1}}s_{k+2}\xrightarrow{\alpha_{k+2}}\ldots$ in $M$
        - $\beta$ is moved to appear before $\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2\ldots\alpha_{k-1}$.
      - $\beta(s_k)=s_{k+1}\implies\beta(s_k)\xrightarrow{\alpha_{k+1}}s_{k+2}=s_{k+1}\xrightarrow{\alpha_{k+1}}s_{k+2}$

2. Some $\beta\in\mathit{ample}(s_0)$ is independent of all the transitions that appear on $\theta_i$.
   - There is a path $\xi=s_0\xrightarrow{\beta}\beta(s_0)\xrightarrow{\alpha_0}\beta(s_1)\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}\beta(s_2)\xrightarrow{\alpha_2}\ldots$ in $M$.
     - $\beta$ is executed from $s_0$ and then applied to each state of $\theta_i$.

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

- In both cases, $\eta_{i+1}=\eta_{i}\circ(s_0\xrightarrow{\beta}\beta(s_0))$.
- $\theta_i$ is the path that is obtained from $\xi$ by erasing the first transition $s_0\xrightarrow{\beta}\beta(s_0)$.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Let $\eta$ be the path such that the prefix of length $i$ is $\eta_i$. The path $\eta$ is well defined since $\eta_i$ is constructed from $\eta_{i-1}$ by appending a single transition.

2. 
   1. (Cont.) $\beta$ is invisible, so $\forall\;l\in\left(0,k\right], L(s_1)=L(\beta(s_l))$.
      - Order of invisible transitions remains unchanged. So all parts follow immediately.
   2. $\pi_{i+1}$ have an additional invisible transition $\beta$ compare to $\pi_i$.
      - Replace some suffix $s_0\xrightarrow{\alpha_0}s_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}\ldots$ of $\pi_i$ by $s_0\xrightarrow{\beta}\beta(s_0)\xrightarrow{\alpha_0=\alpha}\beta(s_1)\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}\ldots$.
      - Thus, $L(s_l)=L(\beta(s_l))$ for $l\geqslant 0$
      - Order of invisible transitions remains unchanged. Similar to the previous case.
      - All parts follow immediately.

# Correctness of the Algorithm
Three useful lemmas

These lemmas will be used to show that the path $\eta$ that is constructed as the limit of the finite paths $\eta_i$ contains all of the visible transitions of $\sigma$, and in the same order.

<Lemma title="12.8">

Let $\alpha$ be the first transition on $\theta_i$. Then there exists $j>i$ such that $\alpha$ is the last transition of $\theta_j$, and for $i \leqslant k < j$, $\alpha$ is the first transition of $\theta_k$.

</Lemma>

<span class="font-serif italic font-bold">Proof.</span>

<v-click>

If $\alpha$ is the first transition of $\theta_k$, then

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="1">

- It is the first transition of $\theta_{k+1}$ (case **B**), or
- It will become the last transition of $\eta_{k+1}$ (case **A**).

We need to show that the former case cannot hold for every $k\geqslant i$.

# Correctness of the Algorithm

Suppose, on the contrary, that this is the case. Then, let $s_k=\mathit{first}(\theta_k)$. Consider the infinite sequence $s_i,s_{i+1},\ldots$,

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="3">

- By the above construction, $s_{k+1}=\gamma_k(s_k)$ for some $\gamma_k\in\mathit{ample}(s_k)$.
- Since $\alpha$ is the first transition of $\theta_k$ and was not selected in case **A** to be moved to $\eta_{k+1}$
  - $\alpha$ must be in $\mathit{enabled}(s_k)\backslash\mathit{ample}(s_k)$.
- Since the number of states in $S$ is finite, there is some state $s_k$ that is the first to repeat on the sequence $s_i,s_{i+1},\ldots$
  - There is a cycle $s_k, s_{k+1}, \ldots, s_{r}$, with $s_r=s_k$.
    - $\alpha$ does not appear in any ample sets.
  - Violates **C3**.

# Correctness of the Algorithm

<Lemma title="12.9">

Let $\gamma$ be the first visible transition on $\theta_i$, and let $\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_i)$ be the maximal prefix of $\mathit{tr}(\theta_i)$ that does not contain $\gamma$. Then one of the following holds:
- $\gamma$ is the first transition of $\theta_i$ and the last transition of $\theta_{i+1}$, or
- $\gamma$ is the first visible transition of $\theta_{i+1}$, the last transition of $\eta_{i+1}$ is invisible, and $\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_{i+1}) \sqsubseteq \mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_i)$.

</Lemma>

<v-click>

According to case **A**, the first case holds when

<v-clicks>

- $\gamma$ is selected from $\mathit{ample}(s_i)$, and

<v-click>

Otherwise, according to condition **C2**, $\mathit{ample}(s_i)=\mathit{enabled}(s_i)$.

<v-clicks depth="2">

- By case **B1**, $\beta$ must be the first transition of $\theta_{i}$.
  - Then $\beta$ is a visible transition that precedes $\gamma$ in $\theta_i$. $\implies$ contradiction.

<v-click>

There are three possibilities:

<v-clicks depth="1">

1. $\beta$ appears on $\theta_i$ before $\gamma$ (case **B1** in the construction),
2. $\beta$ appears on $\theta_i$ after $\gamma$ (case **B1** in the construction), or
3. $\beta$ is independent of all the transitions of $\theta_i$ (case **B2** in the construction).

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- In possibilities 1, $\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_{i+1})\sqsubset\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_{i})$

- In possibilities 2 and 3, $\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_{i+1})=\mathit{prefix}_\gamma(\theta_{i})$
  - Since the prefix of $\theta_{i+1}$ that precedes the transition $\gamma$ has the same transitions as the corresponding prefix of $\theta_i$.

The proof is also by induction on the length of $v$.

  - We need to show that $\gamma$ will be eventually added to $\eta_j$ for some $j>i$.
    - And no other visible transitions will be added to the end of $\eta_k$ for $i<k<j$.

# Correctness of the Algorithm
Summary of the lemmas

<v-clicks depth="2">

- ***Lemma 12.10*** states that in the paths $\theta_k$ following $\theta_i$, the transition $\gamma$ continues to be the first visible transition *unless* it is added to some $\theta_j$. 

  - Furthermore, the sequence of transitions before $\gamma$ can only become shorter.

- ***Lemma 12.9*** states that the first transition in each $\theta_k$ is eventually removed and added to the end of some $\eta_l$ where $l > k$. 

  - Consequently, $\gamma$ will also eventually be added to some sequence $\theta_j$.

<Theorem title="12.11">

The structures $M$ and $M^\prime$ are stuttering equivalent.

</Theorem>

<span class="font-serif italic font-bold">Proof.</span> 

<v-click>

Each infinite path of $M^\prime$ that begins from an initial state must also be a path of $M$
- Since it is constructed by repeatedly applying transitions from the initial state.

</v-click>
<v-click>

We need to show that for each path $\sigma=s_0\xrightarrow{\alpha_0}s_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_1}\ldots$ in $M$, there exists a path $\eta=r_0\xrightarrow{\beta_0}r_1\xrightarrow{\beta_1}\ldots$ in $M^\prime$ s.t. $\sigma \sim_{\mathit{st}} \eta$.
- We will show that the path $\eta$ that is constructed above for $\sigma$ is indeed stuttering equivalent to $\sigma$.

</v-click>
<v-click>

First we show that $\sigma$ and $\eta$ have the same sequence of visible transitions; that is,

# Correctness of the Algorithm
Proof of Theorem 12.11

<v-clicks depth="2">

- According to ***lemma 12.10***, $\eta$ contains the visible transitions of $\sigma$ in the same order.
  - Since for any prefix of $\sigma$ with $m$ visible transitions, there is a prefix $\eta_i$ of $\eta$ with the same $m$ visible transitions.
- Also, $\sigma$ must contain the visible transitions of $\eta$ in the same order.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Take any prefix $\eta_i$ of $\eta$

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- According to ***lemma 12.7***, $\pi_i=\eta_i^\circ\theta_i$ has the same visible transitions as $\pi_0=\sigma$.
- Thus, $\sigma$ has a prefix with the *same* sequence of visible transitions as $\eta_i$.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

We create two infinite sequences of indexes: $0=i_0<i_1<\ldots$ and $0=j_0<j_1<\ldots$. These sequences represent stuttering blocks in $\sigma$ and $\eta$ respectively, as stated in the definition of stuttering.

- Assume that both $\sigma=\pi_0$ and $\eta$ have at least $n$ visible transitions.

- Let $j_n$ be the length of the prefix of the smallest prefix $\eta_{j_n}$ of $\eta$ that contains the same sequence of visible transitions as $\xi_{j_n}$.
- $\eta_{j_n}$ is a prefix of $\pi_{j_n}$

# Correctness of the Algorithm

<v-clicks depth="2">

- If both $\sigma$ and $\eta$ have infinitely many visible transitions

  - For $l>j_m, L(r_l)=L(r_{j_m})$.
- Set for $k\geqslant m, i_{k+1}=i_k+1$ and $j_{k+1}=j_k+1$.
- For $k\geqslant 0$
  - The blocks of states $s_{i_k},s_{i_k+1},\ldots,s_{i_{k+1}-1}$ and $r_{j_k},r_{j_k+1},\ldots,r_{j_{k+1}-1}$ are corresponding stuttering blocks that have the same labeling.
