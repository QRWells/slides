# Explicit-State CTL Model Checking

Introduction

### How to determine which states in $S$ satisfy $f$?

<v-click>

Labeling each state $s$ with $label(s)$, which is a set of subformulas that are true in $s$.

</v-click>

<v-clicks depth= "2">

1. Let $label(s)$ be $L(S)$.
2. Then a sub-routine with multiple stages
   1. During the $i$-th stage, subformulas with $i-1$ nested CTL operators are processed.
   2. Subformula that is processed is added to the labeling of each state that in which it is true.
3. Terminated with $M,s\models f \iff f\in label(s)$.

# Explicit-State CTL Model Checking

Introduction

As mentioned in 4.3.1, any CTL formula can be expressed in terms of

$$
\lnot, \lor, \mathbf{EX}, \mathbf{EU}, \mathbf{EG}.
$$

<v-click>

The intermediate stages of the algorithm is able to handle *6* cases:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- $g$ is atomic
- $g$ has one of the forms: $\lnot f_1$, $f_1\lor f_2$, $\mathbf{EX}f_1$, $\mathbf{E}(f_1\mathbf{U}f_2)$, $\mathbf{EG}f_1$.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

For example:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- $\lnot f_1$: states that are not labeled by $f_1$.
- $f_1\lor f_2$: states that is labeled by $f_1$ or $f_2$.
- $\mathbf{EX}f_1$: states that has some successor labeled by $f_1$.

</v-clicks>

# Another Example
The case of $g=\mathbf{EG}f_1$

Based on the decomposition of the graph into *nontrivial strongly connected components*.

<v-click>

> 1. **Strongly connected component (SCC)** is a subgraph such that every node is reachable from every other node along a directed path.
> 2. **Maximal SCC (MSCC)** is a SCC that is not a subset of any other SCC.
> 3. **Nontrivial SCC** is a SCC with more than one node or with only one node with a self-loop.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Let's retain only states that satisfy $f_1$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
M^\prime &= (S^\prime, R^\prime, L^\prime) \\
S^\prime &= \{s\in S\;\vert\; M,s\models f_1\} \\
R^\prime &\models R\vert_{S^\prime\times S^\prime} \\
L^\prime &\models L\vert_{S^\prime}
\end{aligned}
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Note**: $R^\prime$ may not be left-total in this case.

# Another Example
The case of $g=\mathbf{EG}f_1$

<Lemma title="5.1">

$M,\;s\models \mathbf{EG}f_1$ if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. $s\in S^\prime$.
2. There exists a path in $M^\prime$ that leads from $s$ to some node $t$ in a nontrivial MSCC $C$ of the graph $(S^\prime,R^\prime)$.

</Lemma>

<span v-click class="font-serif italic font-bold">Proof.</span>

<v-click >

- **Sufficiency**

</v-click>

<v-click >

It's clearly that:
$$
M,\;s\models \mathbf{EG}f_1 \implies s\in S^\prime. \\
$$

</v-click>

# Another Example
Proof to Lemma 5.1

Let $\pi$ be an infinite path in $M$ starting at $s$, then:

$$
M,\;\pi\models \mathbf{G}f_1 \implies \pi\in S^\prime. \\
$$

<v-click>

Since $M$ is finite, it's possible to write $\pi$ as $\pi=\pi_0\pi_1$, where $\pi_0$ is a finite initial segment and $\pi_1$ is an infinite suffix of $\pi$. Then we will show that $C$ is a nontrivial SCC.

</v-click>
<v-click>

Let $C$ be the set of all states in $\pi_1$. and take states $s_1,s_2\in C$, since $\pi_1$ is an infinite path, then the segment from $s_1$ to $s_2$ is a finite path from $s_1$ to $s_2$ within $C$. So $C$ is a nontrivial SCC.

</v-click>

**Figure**

<v-click>

**Note**: if $C$ is not maximal, then it's contained in an MSCC $C^\prime$ and $\pi_0$ leads to $C^\prime$ since it leads to $C$.

</v-click>

# Another Example
Proof to Lemma 5.1

- **Necessity**

<v-click>

Let $\pi_0$ be the path from $s$ to $t$ in $M^\prime$ and $\pi_1$ be the path of length at least 1 from $t$ back to $t$.

- Since $t$ is in a nontrivial MSCC, then $\pi_1$'s existence is guaranteed.
- All the states on the infinite path $\pi=\pi_0\pi^\omega_1$ satisfy $f_1$.

Since $\pi$ is a path from $s$ in $M$, then $M,\;s\models \mathbf{EG}f_1$. $\square$

</v-click>

<v-click>

<p>

<Link class="font-serif font-bold" to="9">Lemma 5.1</Link> shows that the search of infinite paths can be reduced to the search of an MSCC.

</p>

- The search of SCCs is exponential. (they might include all subsets of $S$)
- The search of MSCCs can be done in linear time.

# Another Example
The case of $g=\mathbf{EG}f_1$

Then the algorithm for the case of $g=\mathbf{EG}f_1$, with the help of Lemma 5.1, turns out to be:

<v-clicks>

1. Construct the Kripke structure $M^\prime=(S^\prime,R^\prime,L^\prime)$.
2. Partition the graph $(S^\prime,R^\prime)$ into its MSCCs using Tarjan's algorithm<sup>1</sup>.
3. Find those states belonging to nontrivial ones.
4. Work backward using the converse of $R^\prime$ like the case of $\mathbf{E}(f_1\mathbf{U}f_2)$.

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="text-xs mt-16">

<sup>1</sup> Tarjan's algorithm (will be introduced in 5.5) finds the set of all MSCCs with time complexity $O(|S^\prime|+|R^\prime|)$.

# Explicit-State CTL Model Checking

General approach

### How to handle arbitrary CTL formula $f$?

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Decompose the formula into subformulas and apply the state-labeling algorithm to them.
- Start with the **shortest** and **most deeply nested** subformulas, and **work outward**.
  - All subformulas of formula currently processing are guaranteed to be processed.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

Since each pass takes time $O(|S|+|R|)$ and $f$ has at most $|f|$ different subformulas,
the total pass requires time:

$$
O(|S|+|R|) \cdot |f| = O(|f|\cdot(|S|+|R|)).
$$

</v-click>

<Theorem v-click title="5.2">

There is an algorithm for determining $\llbracket f \rrbracket$ that runs in time $O(|f|\cdot(|S|+|R|))$.

</Theorem>

# Explicit-State CTL Model Checking
General approach

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Theorem 5.2 holds for every CTL formula over $\mathbf{EX}$, $\mathbf{E(U)}$, and $\mathbf{EG}$.
  - Every other CTL formula can be expressed by means of these three operators. (Chapter 4)
  - Preprocess the CTL formula to obtain a formula containing only $\mathbf{EX}$, $\mathbf{E(U)}$, and $\mathbf{EG}$.
    - All translations are linear in the size of the original formula, except for $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{U})$.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

Recall that:

$$
\mathbf{A}(f\mathbf{U}g) = \neg\mathbf{E}(\neg g\mathbf{U}(\neg f\land\neg g))\land\neg\mathbf{EG}\neg g.
$$

There are only 8 different subformulas, so the overall time complexity is **preserved**.

# Example: Microwave oven
Model-checking algorithm for CTL

Let's check the following CTL formula:

<div v-click>

$$
\mathbf{AG}(Start \to \mathbf{AF} Heat)
$$

</div>

<div v-click class="-mt-4">

$$
\equiv
\neg\mathbf{EF}(Start \land \mathbf{EG}\neg Heat).
$$

</div>

<v-click>

We start by computing the set of states satisfying the APs:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\llbracket Start\rrbracket &= \{2,5,6,7\} \\
\llbracket Heat\rrbracket &= \{4,7\} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

To compute $\llbracket\mathbf{EG}\neg Heat\rrbracket$,
we first find the set of nontrivial SCC in
$S^\prime=\llbracket\neg Heat\rrbracket$.

</v-click>

::right::

<img src="/img/microwave.svg" class="mt-8 dark:invert-93" />

---
level: 3
layout: two-cols
---

We have $MSCC = \lbrace\!\lbrace 1,2,3,5 \rbrace\!\rbrace$.

<v-click>

Then, we set the set of states that should be labeled by $\mathbf{EG}\neg Heat$ to:

$$
T=\bigcup_{C\in MSCC}\{s\vert s\in C\}= \{1,2,3,5\}.
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

No other states in $S^\prime$ can reach state in $T$ along a path **in** $S^\prime$, so the computation terminates with:

$$
\llbracket\mathbf{EG}\neg Heat\rrbracket = \{1,2,3,5\}.
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

Therefore:

$$
\llbracket Start\land\mathbf{EG}\neg Heat\rrbracket = \{2,5\}.
$$

</v-click>

::right::

<v-click>

For $\llbracket\mathbf{EF}(Start \land \mathbf{EG}\neg Heat)\rrbracket$,
we set

$$
T=\llbracket Start\land\mathbf{EG}\neg Heat\rrbracket.
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

And find states that can reach $T$:
$$
\llbracket\mathbf{EF}(Start \land \mathbf{EG}\neg Heat)\rrbracket = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}.
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

Finally, we have:
$$
\llbracket\neg\mathbf{EF}(Start \land \mathbf{EG}\neg Heat)\rrbracket = \emptyset.
$$

The initial state $1$ is not in the set, so the system described by the Kripke structure **does not satisfy the given specification**.
