# CTL Model Checking via Fixpoint Computation
Introduction

In <Link to="5">section 5.1</Link>, we discussed the explicit model-checking algorithm, which manipulates individual states and transitions.

<v-click>

**Symbolic model-checking algorithms** manipulate entire sets of states and transitions.

</v-click>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Based on *fixpoint* characterization of the temporal logic operators.
- Use ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) to represent sets of states and transitions.
- Quadratic time complexity, while explicit model-checking is linear.
- Significantly reduced space complexity.
  - Enables verification of systems with very large state spaces.

Let $M=(S,R,L)$ be a finite Kripke structure. The power set $\mathcal{P}(S)$ is a lattice under the inclusion order.

> A poset $(L,\leq)$ is called a **lattice** if for every pair of elements $a,b\in L$, there exists a **least upper bound** $a\vee b$ and a **greatest lower bound** $a\wedge b$.

<v-clicks>

- Each element $S^\prime$ of the lattice can be viewed as a *predicate* on $S$, where the predicate is true for a state $s$ if and only if $s\in S^\prime$.
- The least element of the lattice is the empty set $\emptyset$ ,we denote it by $\mathit{false}$.
- The greatest element of the lattice is the set $S$ itself, we denote it by $\mathit{true}$.

</v-clicks>

<Def v-click>

A function that maps $\mathcal{P}(S)$ to $\mathcal{P}(S)$ is called a **predicate transformer**.

<Def>

A set $S^\prime\subseteq S$ is a **fixpoint** of a function $\tau: \mathcal{P}(S)\to\mathcal{P}(S)$ if $\tau(S^\prime)=S^\prime$.

</Def>

<v-click>

Let $\tau: \mathcal{P}(S)\to\mathcal{P}(S)$ be a predicate transformer, then:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

1. $\tau$ is ***monotonic*** if $P\subseteq Q \implies \tau(P)\subseteq\tau(Q)$;
2. $\tau$ is ***$\cup$-continuous*** if $P_1\subseteq P_2\subseteq\dotsc \implies \tau(\cup_iP_i)=\cup_i\tau(P_i)$;
3. $\tau$ is ***$\cap$-continuous*** if $P_1\supseteq P_2\supseteq\dotsc \implies \tau(\cap_iP_i)=\cap_i\tau(P_i)$.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

We write $\tau^i(Z)$ to denote $i$ applications of $\tau$ to $Z$. That is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \tau^0(Z) &= Z \\
  \tau^{i+1}(Z) &= \tau(\tau^i(Z)) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

<Theorem title="5.5 (Tarski-Knaster)">

Let $\tau$ be a predicate transformer on $\mathcal{P}(S)$. Then if $\tau$ is monotonic it has a greatest fixpoint, $\nu Z.\tau(Z)$, and a least fixpoint, $\mu Z.\tau(Z)$, defined as follows:

- $\nu Z.\tau(Z) = \bigcup\{Z\;\vert\;Z \subseteq \tau(Z)\}$.
- $\mu Z.\tau(Z) = \bigcap\{Z\;\vert\;Z \supseteq \tau(Z)\}$.

Furhtermore, if $\tau$ is $\cap$-continuous, then $\nu Z.\tau(Z)=\bigcap\tau^{i}(\mathit{true})$, and if $\tau$ is $\cup$-continuous, then $\mu Z.\tau(Z)=\bigcup\tau^{i}(\mathit{false})$.

</Theorem>

<v-click>

<span class="font-serif font-italic font-bold">Proof.</span> Let $\Gamma=\{Z\mid Z\subseteq\tau(Z)\}$ and $P=\cup\Gamma$. Then $\forall Z\in\Gamma, Z\subseteq P$. Thus, for $Z\in\Gamma$:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- $Z\subseteq\tau(Z) \implies \tau(Z) \subseteq \tau(\tau(Z)) \implies \tau(Z)\in\Gamma$; (monotonicity)
- $\tau(Z)\subseteq\tau(P) \implies Z \subseteq\tau(Z) \subseteq \tau(P) \implies P\subseteq\tau(P)$;
- Then we have $P\in\Gamma$ and $\tau(P)\in\Gamma$.

# CTL Model Checking via Fixpoint Computation
Proof of Theorem 5.5

By definition of $\Gamma$, $P\subseteq\Gamma$ and $\tau(P)\subseteq\Gamma$. And since $P=\cup\Gamma$, we have $\tau(P)\subseteq P$. Thus,

$$
\tau(P)=P.
$$

<v-clicks>

- Since $\subseteq$ is reflexive (for any set $S$, $S\subseteq S$), then every fixpoint of $\tau$ is also in $\Gamma$.
- As $P$ includes all sets in $\Gamma$, then $P$ must be the **greatest** fixpoint of $\tau$.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

For the second part of the theorem, we have:

$$
  \tau(S) \subseteq S \implies \tau(\tau(S)) \subseteq \tau(S)
  \implies \tau^{i+1}(S) \subseteq \tau^{i}(S)
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

And by coninuity, we have:

$$
  \tau(\cap\tau^i(S)) = \cap\tau^{i+1}(S) \supseteq \cap\tau^{i}(S) 
  \implies \cap\tau^{i}(S) \in \Gamma \implies \cap\tau^{i}(S) \subseteq P
$$

# CTL Model Checking via Fixpoint Computation
Proof of Theorem 5.5

It's obvious that $P\subseteq S$, so we have:

$$
  P = \tau(P) \subseteq \tau(S) \subseteq S \implies P \subseteq \tau^{i}(S) \implies P\subseteq\cap\tau^{i}(S).
$$

<v-click>

Therefore, $P=\cap\tau^{i}(S)$, that is, $\nu Z.\tau(Z)=\bigcap\tau^{i}(\mathit{true})$. The proof for the least fixpoint is similar so it's omitted here. $\square$

</v-click>

<v-click>

The Knaster Tarski theorem implies:

- if $\tau$ is continuous, then it can be computed by a (possibly infinite) sequence of applications of $\tau$.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Next, some lemmas will be proved to show that:

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- for $\tau: \mathcal{P}(S)\to\mathcal{P}(S)$, if $S$ is finite, then whenever $\tau$ is monotonic, it is also continuous. 
- In this case, only a finite number of applications are needed. 
- Finally, we obtain an algorithm for computing the fixpoints.

<Lemma v-click title="5.6">

If $S$ is finite and $\tau$ is monotonic, then $\tau$ is also $\cap$-continuous and $\cup$-continuous.

</Lemma>

<v-click>

<span class="font-serif font-italic font-bold">Proof.</span>
Let $P_1\subseteq P_2\subseteq\dotsc$ be a sequence of subsets of $S$, then we have $\tau(P_1)\subseteq\tau(P_2)\subseteq\dotsc$

</v-click>

<v-click>

Since $S$ is finite,

$$
  \exists j_0, (\forall j\ge j_0, P_j=P_{j_0}) \land (\forall j < j_0, P_j\subseteq P_{j_0}) \implies \cup_iP_i=P_{j_0} \implies \tau(\cup_iP_i)=\tau(P_{j_0}).
$$

</v-click>

<v-click>

Also we have: 

$$
  \exists j_0, (\forall j\ge j_0, \tau(P_j)=\tau(P_{j_0})) \land (\forall j < j_0, \tau(P_j)\subseteq\tau(P_{j_0})) \implies \cup_i\tau(P_i)=\tau(P_{j_0}).
$$

Therefore $\tau$ is $\cup$-continuous. The proof that $\tau$ is $\cap$-continuous is similar, so omitted here.$\;\square$

<Lemma v-click title="5.7">

If $\tau$ is monotonic, then for every $i$, $\tau^{i}(\mathit{false})\subseteq\tau^{i+1}(\mathit{false})$ and $\tau^{i}(\mathit{true})\supseteq\tau^{i+1}(\mathit{true})$.

</Lemma>

<v-click>

Recall that:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & S \supseteq \tau(S) \implies \tau(S) \supseteq \tau(\tau(S))
  \implies \tau^{i}(S) \supseteq \tau^{i+1}(S) \\
    & \emptyset \subseteq \tau(\emptyset) \implies \tau(\emptyset) \subseteq \tau(\tau(\emptyset))
  \implies \tau^{i}(\emptyset) \subseteq \tau^{i+1}(\emptyset) \\
  \end{aligned}
$$

</v-click>

<Lemma v-click title="5.8">

If $\tau$ is monotonic and $S$ is finite, then there is an integer $i_0$ such that for every $j\ge i_0$, $\tau^{j}(\mathit{false})=\tau^{i_0}(\mathit{false})$. Similarly, there is an integer $j_0$ such that for every $j\ge j_0$, $\tau^{j}(\mathit{true})=\tau^{j_0}(\mathit{true})$.

</Lemma>

<Lemma v-click title="5.9">

If $\tau$ is monotonic and $S$ is finite, then there is an integer $i_0$ such that $\mu Z.\tau(Z)=\tau^{i_0}(\mathit{false})$. Similarly, there is an integer $j_0$ such that $\nu Z.\tau(Z)=\tau^{j_0}(\mathit{true})$.

With these lemmas, we can compute the least fixpoint of $\tau$ if $\tau$ is monotonic.

<v-click>

And the **invariant** of the while loop is given by assertion:

$$
  (Q^\prime=\tau(Q))\land(Q^\prime\subseteq\mu Z.\tau(Z)).
$$

We can see that at the $i$-th iteration of the loop, $Q = \tau_{iâˆ’1}(\mathit{false})$ and $Q^\prime = \tau_{i}(\mathit{false})$. Lemma 5.7 implies that

$$
  \mathit{false}\subseteq \tau(\mathit{false})\subseteq\tau^{2}(\mathit{false})\subseteq\dotsc
$$

Therefore, the maximum number of iterations of the loop is bounded by $|S|$. When the loop terminates, we have $Q=\tau(Q)$ and hence $Q=\mu Z.\tau(Z)$.

<v-click>

Similarly, we can compute the greatest fixpoint also in a finite number of iterations, and it returns $\nu Z.\tau(Z)$:
