# Relational Product Computations
Introduction

Most of the operations used in the symbolic model-checking algorithm are **linear** in the product of the sizes of the operand OBDDs.

<v-clicks depth="3">

- Main exception: relational product operation for $\mathbf{EX}h$:
  $$
    \exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land R(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)]
  $$
  - It's possible to be implmented with one conjunctioin and multiple existential quantifications.
    - But too slow in practice.
  - The OBDD for $h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land R(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$ is often larger than that for final result.
    - It's better to avoid constructing it.

Special Algorithm for Relational Product

An algorithm for arbitrary OBDDs $f$ and $g$.
<v-clicks depth="2">

- Cache the results of the recursive calls.
  - With form $(f,g,E,r)$
- A $(f,g,E,r)$ in the cache means the previous call returns $r$.
- Exponential complexity in the worst case.
  - OBDD for the result is **exponentially larger** than that for $f(\bar{v})$ and $g(\bar{v})$.
  - In this case, no algorithm can do better.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Why it is useful?

<v-clicks depth="2">

- The relational product algorithm needs $R(\bar{v}, \bar{v}^\prime)$ to be **monolithic transition relation**.
  - Consists of single OBDD. (The construction of this from Kripke structure is shown in 8.2)
  - This OBDD is too large in practice.
- **Partitioned transition relations** provide a much more concise representation.
  - But cannot be used in the relational product algorithm we just saw.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Recall the modeling of synchronous circuits in chapter 3.

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="3">

- Transition relations are described in form of $\land$ or $\lor$ of $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$
  - Each piece can be represented by a small OBDD.
  - **Partitioned transition relation**:
    - The model can be represented by a list of OBDDs 
      - Imlicitly conjuncted or disjuncted.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Circuit Modeling Example

<v-clicks depth="3">

- For synchronous circuits: 
    $$
    R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)=(v_i^\prime\equiv f_i(\bar{v}))
    $$
  - **Conjunctive partitioned transition relation**.
    - The transition relation is represented by a list of $R_i$, with implicit conjunction.
- For asynchronous circuits, 
    $$
    R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)=(v_i^\prime\equiv f_i(\bar{v}))\land\bigwedge_{j\neq i}(v_j^\prime\equiv v_j)
    $$
  - **Disjunctive partitioned transition relation**.
    - The transition relation is represented by a list of $R_i$, with implicit disjunction.
    - But the OBDD for $R_i$ may be much larger than that for $f_i$.
      - up to $n$ times larger, where $n$ is the number of variables used to encode the states.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Techinques for efficient representation

Let

$$
N_i(\bar{v},v_i^\prime)=v_i^\prime\equiv f_i(\bar{v})
$$

The pair $(N_i(\bar{v},v_i^\prime),i)$ is used to represent $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$.

<v-clicks>

- Means that $v_i^\prime$ is constrained by $N_i$, if $j\neq i$, then $v_i^\prime$ is constrained to be equal to $v_j$.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Then we exploit this during the relational product computation.

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        &\exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land R(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)]\\
    =   &\exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land(N_i(\bar{v},v_i^\prime)\land\bigwedge_{j\neq i}(v_j^\prime\equiv v_j))]\\
    \end{aligned}
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

with the equivalent expression

$$
    \exist v_i^\prime[h(v_i,\dots,v_{i-1},v_i^\prime,v_{i+1},\dots,v_n)\land N_i(\bar{v},v_i^\prime)].

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Techinques for efficient representation

Partitioned transition relation with one OBDD per state variable

<v-clicks depth="2">

- is often efficient than constructing a monotlithic transition relation.
- But not always best.
- Better to combine some of the $R_i$ into one OBDD by forming their disjunction or conjunction.
  - May be fewer OBDD nodes if the $R_i$ are combined has similar structure near the root.
  - Combining some of the OBDDs may speed up the relational product computation.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Disjunctive partitioning

For a disjunctive partitioned transition relation, the relational product computed is of the form

$$
  \exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land\bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1}R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)].
$$

<v-click>

This can be computed simply distributing the existential quantification over the disjunctions:

$$
  \bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1}\exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)].
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

By this, the computation can be reduced to a series of relational products involving *smaller* OBDDs.

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- Large asynchoronous circuits can be verified efficiently than monotlithic transition relations.

</v-clicks>

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Conjunctive partitioning

For a conjunctive partitioned transition relation, the relational product computed is of the form

$$
  \exist\bar{v}^\prime[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land\bigwedge_{i=0}^{n-1}R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)].
$$

But the existential quantification cannot be distributed over the conjunctions.

<v-click>

There are two observations:

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

1. Circuits exhibit locally, many $R_i$ depend on only a few variables.
   - Combine for a dependence on multiple primed variables sometimes advantageous.
2. Subformulas **do not rely on the variables being quantified** can be moved outside.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Based on these, we can

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- Conjunct the $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$ with $h(\bar{v}^\prime)$.
- Early quantification of variables that are not being depended on.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Conjunctive partitioning

Take the modulo 8 counter example in chapter 3, recall that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R_0(\bar{v},v_0^\prime)&=(v_0^\prime \Leftrightarrow \neg v_0)\\
    R_1(\bar{v},v_1^\prime)&=(v_1^\prime \Leftrightarrow v_0\oplus v_1)\\
    R_2(\bar{v},v_2^\prime)&=(v_2^\prime \Leftrightarrow (v_0\land v_1)\oplus v_2)\\
  \end{aligned}
$$

<v-click>

The relational product for $\mathbf{EX}h$ is

$$
  \exist v_0^\prime \exist v_1^\prime \exist v_2^\prime
  [h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land (R_0(\bar{v},v_0^\prime)\land R_1(\bar{v},v_1^\prime)\land R_2(\bar{v},v_2^\prime))].
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

And can be rewritten as

$$
  \exist v_2^\prime \exist v_1^\prime \exist v_0^\prime
  [\Big(\big(h(\bar{v}^\prime) \land R_0(\bar{v},v_0^\prime)\big)\land R_1(\bar{v},v_1^\prime)\Big)\land R_2(\bar{v},v_2^\prime)].
$$

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- Subformulas can be moved outside the scope of existential quantification.
  - If they don't depend on variables being quantified.

</v-clicks>

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Conjunctive partitioning

Then we can re-express the relational product as

$$
  \exist v_2^\prime\Big[ \exist v_1^\prime\big[ \exist v_0^\prime
  [h(\bar{v}^\prime) \land R_0(\bar{v},v_0^\prime) ]\land R_1(\bar{v},v_1^\prime)\big]\land R_2(\bar{v},v_2^\prime)\Big].
$$

<v-click>

So this can be computed by starting with $h(\bar{v}^\prime)$, at each step:

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

1. Combine the previous result with $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$.
2. Quantify out the appropriate variables.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

Thus, the computation has been reduced to a series of small steps.
</v-click>

<Note v-click class="mt-8">

The intermediate results may depend both on variables in $\bar{v}$ and on variables in $\bar{v}^\prime$.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Conjunctive partitioning

Principles for reordering the conjuncts:
<v-clicks>

- Variables in $\bar{v}^\prime$ can be quantified out early.
- Variables in $\bar{v}$ can be added slowly.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

This reduce the number of variables in the intermediate OBDDs, and thus the size of the OBDDs.

</v-click>
<v-clicks depth="2">

- Computing the RP for $\mathbf{EX}h$ is computing the predecessor of a set of states.
- Sometimes we need to compute the successor of a state set.
  - Quantify out the present state variables.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

The RP for a successor computation has the form:

$$
  \exist v_0 \exist v_1 \exist v_2 [h(\bar{v})\land(R_0(v_0,\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_1(v_0,v_1,\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_2(v_0,v_1,v_2,\bar{v}^\prime))].
$$

</v-click>

<Note v-click>

Unprimed variables are written explicitly, while primed variables are left implicit.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Successor computation

Then it can be rewritten as

$$
  \exist v_0 \exist v_1 \exist v_2 [\Big(\big(h(\bar{v})\land R_2(v_0,v_1,v_2,\bar{v}^\prime)\big)\land R_1(v_0,v_1,\bar{v}^\prime)\Big)\land R_0(v_0,\bar{v}^\prime)].
$$

<v-click>

And then as

$$
  \exist v_0 \Big[\exist v_1 \big[\exist v_2 [h(\bar{v})\land R_2(v_0,v_1,v_2,\bar{v}^\prime)]\land R_1(v_0,v_1,\bar{v}^\prime)\big]\land R_0(v_0,\bar{v}^\prime)\Big].
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

In this case

</v-click>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- The number of new state variables $v_i^\prime$ is **independent** of the ordering
- The number of old state variables $v_i$ remaining at each stage **depends** on the ordering.
  - Minimized by reordering.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Generalize successor computation

This method can be generalized to arbitrary **conjunctive partitioned transition relation** with $n$ state variables.

<v-clicks depth="2">

- A user-defined permutation $\rho$ of $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$.
  - Determines the order in which the partitions $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$ are combined.
- For each $i$, let $D_i$ be the set of variables $v_i^\prime$ that $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$ depends on.
- Let
    $$
      E_i = D_{\rho(i)} - \bigcup_{k=i+1}^{n-1}D_{\rho(k)}.
    $$
  - The set of variables contained in $D_{\rho(i)}$ but not in any $D_{\rho(k)}$ for $k>i$.
  - Pairwise disjoint, and their union contains all the variables.

# Partitioned Transition Relations
Generalize successor computation

So the RP for $\mathbf{EX}h$ can be computed as

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h_1(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime) &= \exist_{v_j^\prime\in E_0}[h(\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_{\rho(0)}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)]\\
    h_2(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime) &= \exist_{v_j^\prime\in E_1}[h_1(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_{\rho(1)}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)]\\
    &\vdots\\
    h_n(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime) &= \exist_{v_j^\prime\in E_{n-1}}[h_{n-1}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_{\rho(n-1)}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)].\\
  \end{aligned}
$$

The final result is $h_n$.

<Note v-click>

If some $E_i$ is empty, then

$$
  h_{i+1}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime) = [h_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)\land R_{\rho(i)}(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)]
$$

and no existential quantification will be used.

Summary

We showed

- A synchronous circuit could be represented by a set of transition relations $R_i(\bar{v},\bar{v}^\prime)$, each depending on exactly one variable in $\bar{v}^\prime$.
- Combining some of the $R_i$ into one OBDD can obtain a **smaller** representation.
- Combining parts of a $R$ **speeds up** the computation of the relational product.
