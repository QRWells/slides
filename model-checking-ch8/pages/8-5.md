# Counterexamples and witnesses
Introduction

CTL model-checking algorithm is able to find *counterexamples* and *witnesses*.

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Formula with $\mathbf{A}$ is false
  - Find a computation path demonstrating the **negation of the formula** is true
- Formula with $\mathbf{E}$ is true
  - Find a computation path demonstrating **why** the formula is true

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

For example, if model checker discovers that:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- $\mathbf{AG}f$ is true $\to$ Produce a path to a state which $\neg f$ holds
- $\mathbf{EF}f$ is true $\to$ Produce a path to a state which $f$ holds

</v-clicks>

<Note v-click>

The *counterexample* for a $\mathbf{A}$ formula is the *witness* for the dual $\mathbf{E}$ formula.

</Note>

<v-click>

With this, we just need to find witnesses for $\mathbf{EX}$ and $\mathbf{EG}$ and $\mathbf{EU}$.

1. Find the SCCs of the transition graph determined by the Kripke structure.
2. Form a new graph whose nodes are the SCCs and whose edges are the edges between the SCCs in the original graph.
   1. There is no proper cycle in the new graph.
   2. Every infinite path must have **a suffix contained within a SCC**.

# Finding Witnesses for CTL formula
Case for $\mathbf{EG}f$

Find a witness for $\mathbf{EG}f$ under fairness constraints $F=\{P_1, \dots, P_n\}$.

<v-click>

Recall that:

$$
\mathbf{EG}f = \bm{\nu Z}.f\land\bigwedge_{k=1}^n\mathbf{EXE}(f\mathbf{U}(Z\land P_k)).
$$

</v-click>
<v-click>

For a state $s$ in $\mathbf{EG}f$, we want to find a path $\pi$:

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- starting from $s$,
- satisfying $f$ in every state,
- visits every set $P\in F$ infinitely often.

</v-clicks>
<v-click>

It can be constructed using a sequence of prefixes of the path of increasing length **until a cycle is found**.

# Finding Witnesses for CTL formula
Case for $\mathbf{EG}f$

<v-clicks depth="3">

1. Evaluate the fixpoint formula. In every iteration of the outer fixpoint computation
    - Compute a collection of least fixpoints associated with $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}(Z\land P))$, for each $P\in F$.
    - For each $P$, we obtain an increasing sequence of approximations $Q_0^P\subseteq Q_1^P\subseteq\dots$
      - $Q_i^P$ is a set containing all states, which can reach a state in $Z\land P$ in at most $i$ steps while satisfying $f$.
    - At last iteration, when $Z=\mathbf{EG}f$, save the sequence of approximations $Q_i^P$ for each $P\in F$.
2. Given a state $s$ in $\mathbf{EG}f$, then:
    - It must have a successor in $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{EG}f\land P))$ for each $P\in F$.
    - Minimize the length of the witness path by choosing the first fairness constraint $P$ that can be reached from $s$.
      - Looking for a successor of $s$ in $Q_0^P, Q_1^P, \dots$, for each $P\in F$.
      - Must be found in some $Q_i^P$.

2. Continue
    - $t$ has a path of length $i$ to a state in $(\mathbf{EG}f)\land P$ so it is in $\mathbf{EG}f$.
    - Then choose any state in intersection of $t$'s successors and $Q_{i-1}^P$.
    - Repeat until $i=0$, we get a path from $s$ to some state $u$ in $(\mathbf{EG}f)\land P$.
    - Then repeat the process for $u$ and other fairness constraints until all fairness constraints are visited, and let the final state be $s^\prime$.
3. For the cycle part, we need a non-trivial path from $s^\prime$ to $t$ along with each state satisfying $f$. 
â†’That is, a witness for $\{s^\prime\}\land\mathbf{EXE}(f\mathbf{U}\{t\})$.
    - If the formula is true, then we found the witness path.
    - Else, the simplest strategy is to restart the procedure from $s^\prime$ using entire $F$.
      - $s^\prime$ is **in** $\mathbf{EG}f$ but **not in** the SCC of $f$, which contains $t$.
      - Eventually find a cycle, or reach a terminal SCC.

- Another way is to **pre-compute** $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}\{t\})$.
  - The first time we exit the set, we know the cycle cannot be completed.
  - So restart from that state.
- These approaches tend to find short counterexamples but shortest cycle.

For $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}g)$ and $\mathbf{EX}f$.

</v-click>
<Note v-click>

$\mathit{fair}$ denotes the set of states satisfying $\mathbf{EG}\mathit{true}$ under fairness constraints $F$.

</Note>

<v-clicks>

- $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}g)$ under $F$ extends to $\mathbf{E}(f\mathbf{U}(g\land\mathit{fair}))$.
- $\mathbf{EX}f$ under $F$ extends to $\mathbf{EX}(f\land\mathit{fair})$.
