# Introduction
Counterexamples and witnesses

CTL model-checking algorithm is able to find *counterexamples* and *witnesses*.

- Formula with $\mathbf{A}$ is false
  - Find a computation path demonstrating the negation of the formula is true
- Formula with $\mathbf{E}$ is true
  - Find a computation path demonstrating why the formula is true

For example, if model checker discovers that:

- $\mathbf{AG}f$ is true $\to$ Produce a path to a state which $\neg f$ holds
- $\mathbf{EF}f$ is true $\to$ Produce a path to a state which $f$ holds

> The *counterexample* for a $\mathbf{A}$ formula is the *witness* for the dual $\mathbf{E}$ formula.

With this, what we need to do is to find witnesses for $\mathbf{EX}$ and $\mathbf{EG}$ and $\mathbf{EU}$.

# Finding Witnesses for CTL formula
Explainition of procedure

<v-clicks depth="2">

1. Find the SCCs of the transition graph determined by the Kripke structure.
2. Form a new graph whose nodes are the SCCs and whose edges are the edges between the SCCs in the original graph.
   1. There is no proper cycle in the new graph.
   2. Every infinite path must have **a suffix contained within a SCC**.

# Finding Witnesses for CTL formula
Case for $\mathbf{EG}f$

Let's find a witness for $\mathbf{EG}f$ under fairness constraints $F=\{P_1, \dots, P_n\}$. Recall that:

$$
\mathbf{EG}f = \bm{\nu Z}.f\land\bigwedge_{k=1}^n\mathbf{EXE}(f\mathbf{U}(Z\land P_k)).
$$
